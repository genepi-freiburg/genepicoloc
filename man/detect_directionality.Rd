\title{Detect effect directionality accounting for allele coding}
\usage{
detect_directionality(ind_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{ind_df}{A data.frame with one row containing allele and effect
information for both datasets. Must include columns:
sumstats_1_ind_A1, sumstats_2_ind_A1, sumstats_2_ind_A2,
sumstats_1_ind_BETA_sign, sumstats_2_ind_BETA_sign}
}
\value{
The input data.frame with an additional 'directionality' column:
\itemize{
\item 1: Effects are in the same direction
\item -1: Effects are in opposite directions
\item NA: Directionality cannot be determined (alleles don't match)
}
}
\description{
Determines whether effects in two datasets have the same or opposite
direction, accounting for potential differences in allele coding between
datasets.
}
\details{
The function handles three cases:
\enumerate{
\item A1 alleles match: Direct comparison of effect signs
\item A1 in dataset 1 matches A2 in dataset 2: Flipped comparison
\item No allele match: Returns NA
}

This is crucial for interpreting colocalization results, as opposite
directions might indicate different causal variants or pleiotropic effects.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Example with matching A1 alleles
df <- data.frame(
  sumstats_1_ind_A1 = "A",
  sumstats_2_ind_A1 = "A", 
  sumstats_2_ind_A2 = "G",
  sumstats_1_ind_BETA_sign = 1,
  sumstats_2_ind_BETA_sign = -1
)
detect_directionality(df)  # Returns df with directionality = -1
}
